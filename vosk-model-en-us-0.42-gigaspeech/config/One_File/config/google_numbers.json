# Googolplex is too large to represent as a string, so I used scientific notation. it's soo big that if every atom in the universe was a one it would still not be enough to represent a googolplex. to attempt to imagine it
#think of the number of atoms in the universe if everyone was a 1, then think of the universe like a ball. now that ball is a binary aka 1 or 0. now every movie ever created to date with how much data that would be needed to store it.
#now multiply that by 1562.5 and that is how big a googolplex is. i struggle to comprehend the entire picture at once and I have hyperphantasia and aspergers. to solidify what i just said just in case. 2MB= 2,000,000 bytes and 8bit's per bytes
#so that is 16,000,000 universe's worth of atoms representing 1 in each of those atoms. (i've only successfully comprehended this with 5min of meditation and i have  130 spatial IQ)
