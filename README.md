# Vosk-Speech-to-Text
Vosk Speech to Text is a Project of an idea i've had since age 5. but speach recognitoin on windows 7 gave me the idea for the STT. Open Caption gave the idea for transcription. which got me thinking if it can understand, just use a program to convert it to actions. Dragon Naturally Speaking was proof of concept gave me the motivation needed to know it's actually possible now. Hence the control your computer part. So about 10yrs in the making... "ish".

WHAT IS IT?
This program is meant to take your voice and transcribe it to any text field. if you're playing a game and want to type in chat but can't type fast enough. just speak it.
that's just 1 example of the idea i have. furthermore the command features. To navigate your computer via your voice. Since I am a privacy advocate aka "paranoid" as some of the non-educated call it. I tried my best to have as little internet access as possible so it's all local processed.


WHY SHOULD I USE IT?
Don't. easy. I'm not going to convince you. I'm doing this for myself. just figured it would be selfish to have something I created that doesn't exist yet all to myself. I inform, up to you to choose after that.

WHAT MAKES YOU CERTIFIED OR WORTH TRUSTING?
You're funny. I have 0 certs. I don't even know how to code. I can semi read and troubleshoot but that's about it. why trust me tho? my philosophy.
vunlerability + authenticity=trust. I am being authentic notice how this is semi formal mostly casual. Also letting you know the purpose of this project. the "hidden agenda" will be in CONTRIBUTIONS.md. that's where you'll get the vunlerability. up to you after that.

HOW DO I DOWNLOAD IT?
1. Clone this repository
2. Download python 3.9 (i haven't tested it outside of 3.9 exact)
3. Download the dependencies run pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Download and unzip https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.42-gigaspeech.zip
5. run one of the dictation.py scripts (e.g. live_gigaspeech_dictation.py)
6. A GUI should pop up.
7. set the path to the Vosk model.
8. set your mic. use test audio to verify. then click start dictation.

OR

WAIT till i work out the bugs necassary and I'll link my patreon so you can download the exe. (if not that complicated. mac and linux. possibly andriod. not iphone since they can't sideload)

WILL YOU BE ADDING MORE FEATURES?
If requested and within the scope of project also my idea. Don't worry it's not that stingy. There are A LOT of features I just didn't put in fear that it would be too combersome and not user friendly. So they are on the back burner. some features weren't part of my initial idea but loved the thought and implimentation. (e.g. waveform)

YOU CLAIM TO NOT KNOW HOW TO CODE. HOW DID YOU CREATE THIS THEN?
B**** AI exists. I know how to utilize it and copy paste workable code from script to script to stack them to further progress along. copy paste into AI. paste error codes. understand what it's trying to say. figure out what features you want vs not. test it. add more features. ask for more idea's. impliment them. troubleshoot again. rinse repeat. Also Visual Studio shows more error messages then command prompt or powershell. only recently found out. i've been troubleshooting via AI and notepad++ for 99% of this. I have 1 script created via VS.
